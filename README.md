# Neural-Network---Fraud-Detection

This project was a part of my Soft Computing Unit. For this project I achieved a 5/5 mark. This project uses MLP Classifiers to develop a neural network which can recognise fraudulent credit card transactions. My neural network achieved a test accuracy of 0.999645, for further information regarding how I developed the neural network, please read the Marked Tutorial 1 - Carter Fitzgerald pdf
